    The reverse and add function starts with a number, reverses its digits, and adds the reverse to the original. If the sum is not a palindrome, repeat this procedure until it does. Write a program that takes number as a string and gives the resulting palindrome (if one exists). If it took more than 1,000 iterations (additions) or yield a palindrome that is greater than 4,294,967,295, assume that no palindrome exist for the given number. The output should be the number of additions performed and the end number.
